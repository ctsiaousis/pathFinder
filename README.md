# pathFinder
A worker is trying to find the optimal path to go to work each morning. For each day he has traffic predictions for each road in his city.
This project compares different path finding algorithms by parsing a file in a format like [this](https://github.com/ctsiaousis/pathFinder/blob/main/pathFinder/sampleGraph1.txt)
and tries to stimulate an AI training procedure for minimizing the difference of prediction days to that of actual days, while finding the optimal path for each day.


You can find the algorithms behind this project on [this](./pathFinder/pathFinder/Algorithms.java) class.
